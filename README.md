Steam Storefront Game Sale Predictor


This project will be using the dataset from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/ycy3sy3vj2/1 in order to analyze patterns in Steam Store data to try and predict certain features, such as predicting when a game might go on sale.
The raw dataset is included in this repo under /data, /data/PlayerCountHistoryPart1, /data/PlayerCountHistoryPart2, and /data/PriceHistory.
The /data/NormalizedPlayerCountHistory files are generated by one of our notebook.ipynb cells.

## Data
We have 3 real features so far in `merged_info.csv`
* release date
* developer
* publisher

We have some features not in `merged_info.csv`
* Genre
* Tags
* Number of Times on Sale (In a dataframe it seems but not the csv)
* Player Count Per Day (Normalized CSVs)
* Price History Per Day (Non-normalized currently)

## Processing The Data

## Example Layout
One way to create different examples is to have each day of the year be an example, the days would be split at a certain point in the year with some used for training and some used for testing. 

## Choosing a Model
Schuman has all classifiers on Canvas that we can run our data through to see if any perform better than others
