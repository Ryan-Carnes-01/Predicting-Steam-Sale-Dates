Steam Storefront Game Sale Predictor
This project will be using the dataset from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/ycy3sy3vj2/1 in order to analyze patterns in Steam Store data to try and predict certain features, such as predicting when a game might go on sale.
The raw dataset is included in this repo under /data, /data/PlayerCountHistoryPart1, /data/PlayerCountHistoryPart2, and /data/PriceHistory.
The /data/NormalizedPlayerCountHistory files are generated by one of our notebook.ipynb cells.
